#Cross section analysis directories and macros description

1. BinResolutionAndUnfolding:
    - For invariant mass bin resolution and unfolding using embedding sample.
    - StRoot contains macros for both the bin resolution and unfolding.
    How to run?
    - Run12pp200Ana.C is the macro that runs the code within StRoot. Run this code interactively, for the test of the macros.
    - Run12pp200Ana.xml is a schedular which can be used to submit all the jobs in schedular.
    - The output is the histograms for each runs. Simply add all histograms with hadd (X.root).
    For bin resolution studiy: 
    - macros_resolution/Resolution.C determines the bin resolution which takes X.root as input.
    For unfolding:
    -macros_unfolding/tunfolddensity_MinConeCut.C does the unflding analysis which takes X.root as input.
    - All unfolding output are stored as histograms in a root file (unfoldingOutput.root)

2. XsecAnalysis:
    - This directory is the main directory where the cross-section analysis is performed. 
    - The StRoot contains macro that reads the data and produces histograms for each runs. 
    - The single combined histogram is used for the further analysis. This contains the histogram for the unfolding input. 
    - macros/xsecAnaMinConecut.C is the main macro which gives the final cross-section result.
    - macros/getAvgQt.C gives the average kinematic values in cross-section bins.
    For luminosity measurement:
    - Luminosity/run12Lumi.cxx gives the total luminosity for jp0, jp1, and jp2 reading the luminosity text file per run.
    For absolute pythia cross-section:
    -PythiaXsec/* is the directory where the absolute pythia cross section is calculated. 
    Results directory:
    - All the final results landed in ResultsMinConeCut.

3. EfficiencyAnalysis:
    - Tracking/StRoot/* and Run12ppAna* produced histograms for the tracking efficiency analysis.
    - Tracking/macros/trackEffana.C takes above produced root file and gives the tracking efficiencies values and plots.

4. TriggerBias: 
    - This directory does the trigger bias systematic uncertainty study as well as trigger efficiency analysis. 
    GetBiased:
    - This directory produces histograms for the triggered yields for the bias and efficiency.
    - StRoot/* and Run12ppAna.* macros are used to produce histograms. 
    GetUnbiased: 
    - This directory produces histograms for the unbiased (pythia) yields for the bias and efficiency. 
    - StRoot/* and Run12ppAna* are used to produce histograms.
    For trigger efficiency:
    - macros/trigEff.C reads both histograms to get the trigger efficiency. 
    For trigger bias:
    - macros/getTriggerBias.C reads both hisg=tograms to get the trigger bias.

5. PID:
    - Embedding based correction for the combinatorial background from the misidentification of pions is done. 
    - StRoot/* and Run12pp200Ana* produces required histograms. 
    - macros/getTruePionFraction.C reads histogram and gives the correction factor and plots.
6. PID_SYS:
    - Embedding based correction for the pion loss due to hard cut on nSigmaPion is done in this directory.
    - StRoot* and Run12pp200Ana* produces required histograms. 
    - macros/getTruePionFraction.C gives that fraction reading above produced histogram.
